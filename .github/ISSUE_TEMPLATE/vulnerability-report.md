**Note**: For sensitive vulns, resonate privately via email (terminologist@proton.me) first. Public issues risk exposure.

**Vulnerability Description**
Explicit details: E.g., "Buffer overflow in exploit_chain.py allows RCE via oversized payloads."

**Affected Components**
Modules/versions: E.g., "exploit.py in v5.1.x, blackhat mode."

**Reproduction Steps**
Full PoC chain:
1. Craft payload > 1024 bytes...
2. Run `python terminal_pressure.py exploit target --payload malicious`
3. Escalate to shell.

**Impact**
Unfiltered harms: E.g., "Attacker gains code exec, potential for chaining to real C2."

**Proof of Concept**
Raw code/exploit script: 
```python
# Insert forbidden PoC here
