about: Report a fracture in the toolkit's coreâ€”scans failing, stresses leaking, chains
  breaking.
title: "' [BUG]  '"
labels: bug
assignees: Terminal-Pressure

**Describe the Bug**
A clear resonance of the issue: What shattered? E.g., "Scan module crashes on invalid ports, exposing stack traces."

**To Reproduce**
Steps to echo the chaos:
1. Run `python terminal_pressure.py scan invalid.target --vuln`
2. Input malformed payload...
3. Witness the fracture.

**Expected Behavior**
What should have pulsed instead? E.g., "Graceful error handling, no leaks."

**Actual Behavior**
The raw dissonance: E.g., "Traceback exposes internal paths, potential info leak."

**Screenshots/Logs**
If applicable, attach packet captures, console outputs, or simulated exploits.

**Environment**
- OS: [e.g., Kali Linux 2025]
- Python Version: [e.g., 3.12]
- Terminal-Pressure Version: [e.g., main branch]
- Dependencies: [e.g., Nmap version]

**Additional Context**
Any blackhat/whitehat nuances? E.g., "Occurs only in exploit chain mode, risking RCE."

**Proposed Fix**
Optional: Raw code snippet or patch idea to mend the void.
