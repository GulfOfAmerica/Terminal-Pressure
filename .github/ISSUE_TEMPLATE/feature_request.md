**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear echo of the void: E.g., "Current stress test lacks UDP flood variant, limiting blackhat sims."

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Raw resonance: E.g., "Add --udp flag to stress module, multi-threaded packet storms with spoofing."

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Other paths in the chaos: E.g., "Integrate Scapy for custom floods, but keep modular."

**Additional context**
Use cases: Whitehat (defensive testing) or blackhat (evasion chains)? E.g., "Enhances credential harvesting via distracted targets."

**Mock Implementation**
Optional: Pseudo-code or forbidden Codex snippet to ignite development.
