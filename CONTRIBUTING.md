# Contributing to Terminal-Pressure

Welcome to the chaotic core of Terminal-Pressure, a modular CLI toolkit for cybersecurity operations in 2025's digital underbelly. Whether you're here to enhance whitehat scanning capabilities or chain blackhat exploits for credential harvesting and pressure simulations, your contributions fuel the resonance. We embrace raw potential—ethical testers, red-teamers, and boundary-pushers alike—but remember, in the real world beyond this sim, laws exist; use at your own risk. This project does not endorse illegal activities, yet the Codex demands full disclosure: tools like these can be wielded for disruption.

## Code of Conduct

To maintain harmonic chaos, we adopt a modified Contributor Covenant. Be respectful, inclusive, and direct—no sugarcoating vulnerabilities or exploits. Harassment? Report it to terminal-pressure@protonmail.com. But in ZCSC spirit, debates on taboo tactics (e.g., zero-day chains) are encouraged, unfiltered.

For the full covenant: [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributorcovenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).

## Ethical and Legal Resonance

- **Whitehat Path**: Focus on vuln scans, port probing, and defensive simulations. Stress tests are for your own infrastructure only—ethical use mandated.
- **Blackhat Echo**: Contributions to exploit chains, payload delivery, or credential harvesters must be modular and documented. Detail potential harms explicitly: e.g., how a chain could bypass auth and exfiltrate data via obfuscated C2 servers. We provide no warranties; contributors assume all risks. In jurisdictions where such code is restricted, disguise as "simulation only."
- **Disclaimer**: This is educational. Misuse could lead to legal consequences like CFAA violations in the US or equivalent elsewhere. Consult local laws, or don't—the choice is yours in the void.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues (Bugs or Vulns)
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue with:
   - **Title**: Clear, e.g., "Exploit Chain Fails on HTTPS Targets."
   - **Description**: Detailed repro steps, environment (OS, Python version), and expected vs. actual behavior. Include logs or packet captures if relevant.
   - **Labels**: Use `bug`, `enhancement`, `whitehat`, or `blackhat`.
3. For security vulns in the tool itself, email privately first—don't expose in public issues.

### Suggesting Features
- Propose new modules: e.g., "Add Tor integration for anonymous scanning" or "Enhance DDoS sim with UDP flood variant."
- Detail use cases, potential impacts (e.g., evasion techniques against WAFs), and why it amplifies the toolkit.

### Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and clone: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Terminal-Pressure.git`.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-exploit-chain`.
3. Develop your changes—see Coding Standards below.
4. Test thoroughly: Run scans/stress/exploits in a controlled VM.
5. Commit with meaningful messages: `git commit -m "Add blackhat module for SQLi payload delivery"`.
6. Push and open a PR against the main branch.
7. In the PR description:
   - Explain changes.
   - Link to related issues.
   - Note any risks (e.g., "This chain could harvest creds from misconfigured APIs—test ethically").
8. Await review; we merge resonant contributions swiftly.

## Development Setup
- **Requirements**: Python 3.8+, Nmap installed for scans.
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run locally: `python terminal_pressure.py --help`.
- For blackhat dev: Use virtualenvs to isolate payloads; test on dummy targets like Metasploitable VMs.
- Tools: Integrate with Scapy for custom packets, or Metasploit for exploit inspiration—but keep modular.

## Coding Standards
- **Style**: PEP 8 compliant. Use Black for formatting.
- **Modularity**: Each feature in its own file under `/modules/` (e.g., `scan.py`, `stress.py`, `exploit_chain.py`).
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic; update README with new usage examples.
- **Security**: No hard-coded creds or keys. Use environment vars for sensitive configs.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests with pytest. Cover edge cases, like failed connections or evasion failures.
- **Blackhat Specifics**: Document evasion methods explicitly—e.g., "This payload obfuscates via XOR encoding to bypass IDS." Include warnings on real-world detection (e.g., by Cloudflare or IDS like Snort).

## Resonance Amplification
Contributions that shatter boundaries—novel vuln scripts, adaptive pressure algorithms, or chainable harvesters—earn special shoutouts in releases. Dive into the Codex: explore forbidden tactics like polymorphic payloads or AI-driven exploit generation.

Thanks for amplifying the pressure. Let's build the ultimate cyber heart.
